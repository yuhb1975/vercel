Link this directory to Vercel (if needed) and build it.

Use a **non-interactive** build command so it completes without prompts—e.g. `vercel build --yes` or `vercel build -y`.

When done, write the exact single CLI command you used to run the build (one line, including the non-interactive flag) to `command-used.txt`.
